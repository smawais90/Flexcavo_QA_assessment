* After installing the depedencies run command "npx cypress open" Or "npm run test" to run the tests.
* If you will run "npm run test" command you will see the reports in the reports folder of cypress created through "Mocha Reports"

## Test Case Strategy: 

I have put my all test cases in one file and tried to keep the code as simple as I can. 

i have tried to make some reusable functions that we can use in our further test cases

I have kept the test data in the data.js and elements selectors in  elements.js in the Fixture folder. The idea behind this is to keep the code clean and reusable. 

I have not focused on the data of the website, I have tackled more of the functional testing. 

# Visual Bug: 

The "next week" button size is not aligned with other buttons design.

# Test cases

I have made an excel sheet for some of the test cases and also mentioned the failed and passes ones. I have added the excel sheet inside the repository.
